## GlaNet
Deep neural network for surface glacier mapping

## Dataset
Dataset for model training is introduced at: https://github.com/Hydrological-Observation-Group/glacier_mapping.git.    


## to do  
* comparing with the unet, unet++, deeplabv3+, and another semantic segmentation models.        
* plot accuracy among the methods.     
* modify rs image normalization method, normalize each image with its percentile 2 and percentile 98 values. 
* modify the unet_scales to u2net_scales, and to u2net_att_scales.
* add Dice metric
